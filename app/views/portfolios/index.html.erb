<!-- This is a manual collection because we changed the naming
  of portfolios creating portfolio items. Blog works
  because the convention of naming Blogs is used everywhere
  as it is and did not get changed anywhere. But for portfolio
  we changed some namingspaces etc. Turning it into a
  Manual collection.
  We are saying that it will have to go to the following portfolio_item with
  the following collection -->
