    <p>With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical
    product creation process between client and developers was flawed. Too often developers rarely communicate
    to clients throuhout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought
    by the customer and end user.</p>

    <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly
    focused communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft
    the application according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is
    aligning properly with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on
    budget.</p>
